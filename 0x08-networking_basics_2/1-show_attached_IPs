# This command for Script tp Display all IPV4 IPS

# This script displays all IPv4 addresses attached to the system.
# It uses the 'ifconfig' command to get the network interface details,
# the 'grep' command to filter out lines containing the word 'inet',
# the 'cut' command to extract the IPv4 address from the output,
# and the 'cut' command again to remove the leading whitespace.

# Get the network interface details
network_interfaces=$(ifconfig -a)

# Filter out lines containing the word 'inet'
inet_lines=$(echo "$network_interfaces" | grep inet)

# Extract the IPv4 address from the filtered lines
ipv4_addresses=$(echo "$inet_lines" | cut -d: -f2 | cut -d" " -f1)

# Print the extracted IPv4 addresses
echo "$ipv4_addresses"
