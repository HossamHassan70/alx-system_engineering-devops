# Regular expression

A **regular expression** (often shortened to **regex** or  **regexp** ) is a sequence of characters that defines a pattern for matching text. These patterns are commonly used by string-searching algorithms for tasks like finding specific substrings or performing find-and-replace operations on strings. Regular expressions are also useful for input validation.

Here are a couple of online tools where you can learn, build, and test regular expressions:

1. **[RegExr](https://regexr.com/)** : This web tool supports both JavaScript and PHP/PCRE flavors of regular expressions. You can edit expressions, input text, and see real-time matches. [It provides syntax highlighting, a cheat sheet, reference, and community patterns](https://regexr.com/).
2. **[regex101](https://regex101.com/)** : Another interactive web tool for creating, testing, and debugging regular expressions. [As you type, it shows explanations, match information, quick references, and substitution results](https://regex101.com/).
